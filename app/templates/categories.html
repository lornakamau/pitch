  <h4 class="text-center">What is a Twitter Pitch?</h4>
  <p class="card-text">A Twitter pitch is one that summarizes your whole idea in one punchy sentence. Your tweet pitch
    should explain what problem is being solved or what the solution might be. This is best for when you meet someone at
    an event and they have never heard of your company and is used to gauge your audience's receptiveness. <a
      href="{{url_for('main.new_pitch', uname=current_user.username)}}">Add your Pitch</a> and have other users vote
  and comment on it.</p>

  {%elif category_name == "Elevator"%}
  <h4 class="text-center">What is an Elevator Pitch?</h4>
  <p class="card-text">The idea is that this pitch should last as long as an elevator ride, that is between 15 seconds
    and a couple of minutes. To craft a good elevator pitch, take the following things into consideration:
    <ul>
      <li>Define the goal of your pitch</li>
      <li>Explain briefly but clearly what you do</li>
      <li>Communicate your USP - Unique Selling Point</li>
      <li>Engage the listener with one good question</li>
    </ul>
    <a href="{{url_for('main.new_pitch', uname=current_user.username)}}">Add your Pitch</a> and have other users
  vote and comment on it.</p>

  {%elif category_name == "Competition"%}
  <h4 class="text-center">What is a Competition Pitch?</h4>
  <p class="card-text">This is longer than Elevator and Twitter pitches. It needs to be presented with a pitch deck. The
    deck you will be building is very similar to the one you would use to send to investors. The pressure is high and
    you have a limited amount of time to catch everyoneâ€™s attention. You need to make the most out of it. <a
      href="{{url_for('main.new_pitch', uname=current_user.username)}}">Add your Pitch</a> and have other users vote
  and comment on it.</p>

  {%elif category_name == "Investor"%}
  <h4 class="text-center">What is an Investor Pitch?</h4>
  <p class="card-text">To present this, one would use a media deck to deliver their message. When talking with
    investors,
    make sure to spend time on the problem, solution (unique technology) and, of course, traction. This is THE pitch
    that you need to get ready for the most. The people in front of you are the ones that could give you money to
    transform your dream
    into reality. <a href="{{url_for('main.new_pitch', uname=current_user.username)}}">Add your Pitch</a> and have
  other users vote and comment on it.</p>
