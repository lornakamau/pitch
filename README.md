#### By Lorna Kamau

## Description
Owing to the fact that one has only 60 seconds to make an impression and consequently the impact of a good pitch, Pitch was developed. The aim is to allow users to visit the site and get inspiration on how to write the best pitch. Users can also submit their own pitches, vote and/or comment on submitted pitches.
